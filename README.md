Hello, 

My name is Julie. 

In my youthful days, I had always imagined how a computer could do all that it did. 
This motivated me to pursue a degree in Computer Science. 
I learnt a lot about data handling and computer operations using FORTRAN, Pascal and COBOL languages.

 Moreover, I have a passion for teaching. 
 By this I mean, I enjoy bringing a novice into knowledge. 
 This inspired me to establish a Computer Training Center, where I trained individuals on the use of MS Word and Excel for their office work.

Today, many organizations rely on Python for data management and backend operations. 
So, I took delight in learning Python Programming. I am now a Python Backend Developer. 
I have been able to develop a world-wide weather project, product review project and others. 

In addition, I had a self-study on JavaScript with React tools. I used this for designing the frontend of my product review project. 

I am eager to contribute my expertise in data handling, front and backend operations (fullstack) to the growth of your company.

Thanks for reading this. And I look forward to the opportunity to be part of your team.
