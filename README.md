Hello,

My name is Julie. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and completed a professional training in Python Backend Programming at the Digital Career Institute, Berlin. Additionally, I pursued self-directed training in JavaScript with React tools, which I applied in building my final project at DCI - Product Review, a fullstack web application designed to simplify product feedback using Django REST API and React (https://github.com/nkemdilimjulie/Product-Review-code).

Among other technical skills, I have a strong customer-oriented mindset, excellent communication skills in both German and a very good English and intercultural sensitivity and empathy—qualities that enable me to work effectively in diverse, agile teams. 

I look forward to be given the opportunity to bring my talent of problem solving into your company.

Thanks a lot for your time.

Julie
