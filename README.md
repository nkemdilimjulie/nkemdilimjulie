Hello,

My name is Julie. I hold a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and completed a technical training in Python Backend Programming at the Digital Career Institute (DCI), Germany.

I am  passionate about learning new technologies. So, I undertook self-study in JavaScript using React, which I applied, together with Django REST API,  to build a fullstack web application for my final project at DCI - Product Review: https://github.com/nkemdilimjulie/Product-Review-code and TypeScript with Angular which I used to design my Portfolio: https://github.com/nkemdilimjulie/nkemdilimjulie-portfolio.

What empower me to work effectively in a diverse and agile team is my excellent communication skills in both German and English language, intercultural sensitivity and empathy. For my other skills, you can check on me in LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nkemdilim-julie-chime-13a755339/. 

I look forward to be given the opportunity to bring my talent of problem solving into your company.

Thanks a lot for your time.

Julie
